// we can hold only premitive data type which we declired
// Array Example
// Create an array of words
        String[] words = new String[10];
        words[0] = "one";
        words[1] = "two";
        words[2] = "three";
        words[3] = "four";
        words[4] = "five";
        words[5] = "six";
        words[6] = "seven";
        words[7] = "eight";
        words[8] = "nine";
        words[9] = "ten";
 /*
 or we can use
 String words [] = new String [] {"one","two","three","four","five","six","seven","eight","nine","ten"};

  */

// Working with An ArrayList
// we can hold object data type in this ArrayList
